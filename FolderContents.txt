This folder is an Aruino SketchBook folder for the ReflowSolderController plus associated library and hardware design files.

To open the build environment in the Arduino IDE under Preferences set the Sketchbook location to this top folder.
Then under File/Sketchbook open the sketch RefllowController.ino -- This should be the only sketch available.

Note that all the libraries for the project are local to this sketchbook making it so that the correct 
revision is always linked with the sketch.
